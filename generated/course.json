          "details": "Asset tokenization is the process of representing ownership of a physical or digital asset using a digital token on a blockchain. These tokens can be traded and transferred like other cryptocurrencies, allowing for more efficient and secure trading of assets such as real estate, fine art, and even stocks. Tokenization also allows for fractional ownership of assets, making them more accessible to a wider range of investors.\n\n\n\n",
