          "details": "A token is a digital unit of cryptocurrency that is either used as a specific asset or it represents a particular use on the blockchain. Tokens can have multiple use cases but the most common ones are as security, utility or governance tokens. \n\nAsset tokenization refers to the process of creating a digital token that represents a physical or digital asset, such as real estate, artwork, or even company shares, on a blockchain network. \n\nThis token can then be bought, sold, and traded like any other cryptocurrency, and can also enable fractional ownership of assets, making it more accessible to a wider range of investors. Tokenization can also enable smart contract functionality, which can automate the process of buying and selling assets, and can also provide a tamper-proof and transparent record of ownership.\n\n## Use Cases of Tokenization\nThere are many examples of tokenized assets, some of which include:\n\n1. **Real estate**: Tokenization allows for the creation of digital tokens that represent ownership of a physical property, enabling fractional ownership and more efficient trading of real estate.\n\n2. **Art**: Tokenization can be used to represent ownership of fine art, making it more accessible to a wider range of investors and collectors.\n\n3. **Stocks**: Tokenization can be used to represent ownership of company shares, enabling more efficient and secure trading of stocks.\n\n4. **Commodities**: Tokenization can be used to represent ownership of commodities such as gold, oil, and other precious metals, enabling more efficient trading and storage.\n\n5. **Collectibles**: Tokenization can be used to represent ownership of collectible items such as sports cards, comic books, and other rare items, making it more accessible to a wider range of collectors.\n\n6. **Music rights**: Tokenization can be used to represent ownership of music rights, making it more efficient for creators and investors to manage and monetize music.\n\n7. **Luxury goods**: Tokenization can be used to represent ownership of luxury goods such as designer clothes, watches and handbags, making it more accessible for investors and collectors.\n\nThese are just a few examples and the possibilities are endless, as any asset can be tokenized.\n",

          "shortTitle": "Benefits",
          "details": "1.  **Global Reach** - Some of the most stable companies to invest in are ones like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Tesla. However, there are plenty of people globally who don't have access to these modern growth stocks. Blockchain enables a global financial system, giving small investors the opportunity to invest across borders. This allows everyone to have a fair chance at growing their wealth.\n\n2. **Increased Speed and Lower Cost** - With automation in the issuance, distribution, and management of securities, as well as securities servicing and corporate actions, the entire securities transaction process becomes more efficient and cost-effective for both issuers and investors. Additionally, the distributed nature of the network with no single point of failure, the immutability of the ledger, and the application of cryptography make the infrastructure more resilient and safe.\n\n3. **Transparency** - Transparency is one of the key benefits that blockchain technology can bring to the financial markets. By enhancing information recording and sharing, blockchain can help create a more transparent market environment, with data that is more accurate and reliable. This in turn can help boost investor confidence and make the markets more efficient. Additionally, the decentralized nature of blockchain can help reduce the risks of fraud and corruption, as well as improve audibility.\n\n4. **Fractional Ownership** -  As blockchain assets can be divided into smaller units, this increases liquidity. For example, a traditional real estate transfer usually requires the entire property to be transferred from seller to buyer. However, when real estate is tokenized, it can be divided and sold as units. This makes it easier to trade in a number of ways. There are lower capital requirements for potential buyers, which expands the pool of potential investors. Shares of a tokenized asset are more affordable, making it more accessible to a wider range of people solving high price entry barriers.\n\n5. **Cost savings** -  Tokenization has the potential to reduce costs in a variety of ways, for example, by settling trades instantaneously, reducing delivery charge as assets are sold digitally . By this risk for the fund is also greatly reduced. Tokens also allow for secondary market trading, which could help maintain assets under management while simultaneously reducing the cost of maintaining liquidity in the fund. Tokenizing also helps owners keep track of their assets as well as gives them more control over their investment.\n\n6. **Better Regulation** - real-time information about on-chain events can help regulators better understand what's happening with specific projects. This, in turn, can lead to more informed decision-making when it comes to compliance and interactions with those behind the project.\n",

          "shortTitle": "Downsides",
          "details": "While tokenization has many potential benefits, including innovation, efficiency, security and enhanced liquidity, it also has some potential downsides.\n\n* **Complexity**: Tokenization can be a complex process, requiring technical expertise and specialized knowledge of blockchain technology. There is a steep learning curve on both the token issuer and the user side. The first step of getting started with  blockchain is setting up a wallet and getting some funds in, which in itself can be a very complex task for non technical users.\n\n* **Security risks**: Your tokens are always at risk of being lost if you forget your private key or if someone gets access to it. Since the cryptocurrency industry is not regulated, there are no checks by any government authority. In 2022, we saw many customers lose their funds as many exchanges were using customer's tokens for riskier bets without their consent.\n\n* **Regulation**: Tokenization is a new and unregulated area, which can create uncertainty and potential legal issues. Until the technology and tokens themselves are regulated, it cannot get investment from some of the biggest institutions like pension funds etc.\n\n* **High transaction fees**: Tokenization can be a great way for fractional ownership or getting liquidity, but it's important to be aware of the potential fees involved. When transacting on Bitcoin or Ethereum, for example, you may have to pay transaction fees. In contrast, many simple transactions made through centralized banks are free of charge. Additionally, banks often profit from hidden fees - which is not typically the case in decentralized finance.",

          "shortTitle": "Token Types",
          "details": "A Token can be thought of as a representation of value that can be exchanged or traded in most cases.\n\nThere are many different types of tokens:\n1) **Coins/AltCoins** - These are native to blockchain and can be used for payments or to power transactions. The most \n   famous type of coins are Bitcoin(BTC) and Ethereum(ETH). These are normally awarded to the validators of the \n   transaction, but can also be bought and exchanged.\n2) **Security tokens** -  are digital assets that represent some type of underlying asset, equity, or commodity. There are many different types of security tokens, including:\n\n   1) **Stocks or Bonds** - These tokens represent an underlying stock or bond. They help investors from any country gain exposure to one of the most famous stocks or bonds.\n\n   2) **Commodities** - These tokens represent a commodity, such as gold or oil. They help investors from any country gain exposure to the commodity market.\n\n   3) **Real Estate** - These tokens represent a piece of property. They help investors from any country gain exposure to the real estate market.\n3) **Protocol/product tokens** - these tokens are issued by a protocol and may or may not have any utility or governance power related to them. Examples of these tokens include MKR, AAVE and COMP. \n4) **Utility Tokens** - they can serve any purpose that a developer wants them to. In general, utility tokens provide access to a specific service or product within a blockchain ecosystem. They can often be the same as the protocol token or can be different. \n5) **Governance Tokens** - Governance tokens are primarily used for voting and decision-making within a protocol or organization. They may also offer some financial incentives, but their main purpose is to give token holders a say in how the protocol or organization is run.\n6) **Cause-Based Tokens** - they are designed to support a specific cause or charity. They typically don't offer any financial incentives or utility, but are meant to show support for the cause they represent. \n7) **NFTs** - NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are a type of cryptocurrency that is limited in supply and has a unique identity. NFTs are difficult to copy or replicate, making them ideal for representing digital or real-world assets such as paintings, photographs, or other materials.\n\nAsset token primary relates to **Security Tokens**.\n\nFor asset or equity-backed tokens, there is usually a custodian and an investment institution involved in the process of creating a tokenized stock, assets or commodities. The institution buys the underlying stock and deposits it with the custodian. Based on the number of shares that the custodian holds in reserve, tokens are issued on a blockchain. The price of each token is pegged to the value of the shares.This process allows for a more efficient way of buying and selling stocks or assets, as well as a more secure way of storing them. By using a blockchain, there is no need for a third party to keep track of ownership or transactions. This makes the process more transparent and less susceptible to fraud.\n\nIn 2022, many cryptocurrency exchanges went bankrupt because the tokens they were holding were not kept isolated. These exchanges were centralized entities that were built on top of decentralized technology, and they didn't disclose whether or not users' funds were backed 1:1 at all times. As an educated blockchain user, we should be aware whenever we are depositing custody of our assets or tokens to anyone else.",

          "details": "In 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ruled that digital asset securities must follow the same regulations as traditional securities. The SEC sees digital asset securities as under their domain and, as such, these assets are subject to the same laws as traditional securities. Security tokens, in the form of digital asset securities, represent a fractional ownership in an underlying asset. These assets can be investments like real estate, fine art, or venture capital. They can also be digital assets like a website, app, or even a blockchain. \n\nInvestors can purchase security tokens using fiat currencies such as the USD or cryptocurrencies such as BTC or ETH. \n\nAlthough both digital asset securities and cryptocurrencies are tokens, it's important to note that they are not interchangeable. Comparing them would be like comparing a share of stock to a dollar bill, or to reward points. Cryptocurrencies can have various usages and utility, and not all the rules that apply to security tokens are applicable to other types of tokens.\n\nDigital Asset Securities (or “security tokens”) enable a 100% digital experience, removing\nlag-time while providing real-time data on cap tables and shareholder activity.

          "details": "Rules of creation of tokens are implemented in a smart contract and then this smart contract is deployed to a blockchain. \n\n\n## Token Creation\nSecuritize offers a lot of flexibility for the creation of your Token. If you are a blockchain developer with programming experience, you can create a token programmatically with all the rules required. However, Securitize automates most of these for token issuers and hides the technical complexity, and makes this process very simple even for non-technical people. Following are the steps involved when you create a new token in Securitize:\n\n### Determine the Blockchain\nSecuritize is blockchain agnostic, which means they have created integrations with multiple different blockchains in order to be able to work with a variety of projects. They work with the projects to identify the most appropriate blockchain for their tokenization by considering various factors such as gas fees and interoperability with the ecosystem. By doing this, they are able to provide each project with the best possible solution for their needs.\n\n### Define the Smart Contract\nBefore tokenizing an asset or security, it’s crucial to establish what rights will be given to shareholders (i.e. voting rights), how many tokens will be issued, and what compliance requirements and legal limitations, such as jurisdictional restrictions, the digital asset should include. Once these conditions have been defined, they set up the smart contracts for the tokens and introduce the configuration in the Securitize Control Panel, which is linked to the company’s Issuer Portal.\n\n### Issuance of Tokens \nOnce an investment round has been completed and the full cap table has been uploaded to the Issuer Panel, Securitize will deploy the smart contracts. Once the smart contracts are deployed, each investor can issue the tokens. To facilitate the process, your Securitize Client Success Manager will complete the issuance for you via the Issuer Portal. Your investors are notified when the tokens are issued.\n\n\n\n## References\nhttps://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/securitizemarkets.io/caseStudies/How-to-Tokenize+Your+Asset+%5Bincl+end-to-end%5D+.pdf",

          "details": "Earlier, only accredited or institutional investors were able to invest in companies that were not publicly traded on stock exchanges. If such private companies needed to raise funds, they had to issue debt or equity to these accredited investors. However, this created a loophole in the investing process, as these private companies were not open  to offer any stake in the business to the general public. \n\nThis changed with the introduction of crowdfunding, which allows anyone to invest in a company in return for equity. However, the stake in private companies can only be diluted if the company is listed on a stock exchange or acquired by another company. This means that the invested funds can be locked up for a long period of time. \n\nBlockchain technology provides a solution to this by allowing private companies to tokenize their equity and offer those tokens to investors through crowdfunding or offering them on blockchain protocols. These tokens can then easily be traded on secondary markets, giving investors the freedom to trade their investment at any time they want.\n\nSecuritize offers primary and secondary offerings to allow anyone to invest in private companies and other major funds (eg:- Art funds).\nThe main difference between primary and secondary offerings on securitize is that primary market offerings have a minimum lock-up period of one year, and investors get voting rights in decisions related to the particular fund. In contrast, secondary market offerings don't have a lock-up period, and investors don't get voting rights. In primary offerings, once the lock-up period of 1 year is over, investors have to find a potential buyer of the token to divest .\n",
