          "details": "Asset tokenization refers to the process of creating a digital token that represents a physical or digital asset, such as real estate, artwork, or even company shares, on a blockchain network. This token can then be bought, sold, and traded like any other cryptocurrency, and can also enable fractional ownership of assets, making it more accessible to a wider range of investors. Tokenization can also enable smart contract functionality, which can automate the process of buying and selling assets, and can also provide a tamper-proof and transparent record of ownership.\n\n\n\n",
