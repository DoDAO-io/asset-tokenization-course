## Securitize Protocol
 
Securitize is the perfect solution for companies looking to tokenize assets as part of a capital raise. They manage the entire process from legal setup and valuation, to auditing and investor onboarding, tokenization and cap table management. It ensures that the entire process is compliant with regulations, so companies can focus solely on running their business. 

In this chapter we will learn how "Token Issuers" and "Investors" can use Securitize. We will also discuss the primary and secondary markets feature provided by securitize.
