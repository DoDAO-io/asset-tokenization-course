 **Token Creation**        
Securitize helps manage the full lifecycle of the token i.e. from creation to deployment, and to issuance.


## Token Creation
Securitize offers a lot of flexibility for the creation of your Token. If you are a blockchain developer with programming experience, you can create a token programmatically with all the rules required. However, Securitize automates most of these for token issuers and hides the technical complexity, and makes this process very simple even for non-technical people. Following are the steps involved when you create a new token in Securitize:

1. **Determine the Blockchain** - Securitize is blockchain agnostic, which means they have created integrations with multiple different blockchains in order to work with a variety of projects. They work with the projects to identify the most appropriate blockchain for their tokenization by considering various factors such as gas fees and interoperability with the ecosystem. By doing this, they can provide each project with the best possible solution for their needs.

2. **Define the Smart Contract** - Before tokenizing an asset or security, it’s crucial to establish what rights will be given to shareholders (i.e. voting rights), how many tokens will be issued, and what compliance requirements and legal limitations, such as jurisdictional restrictions, the digital asset should include. Once these conditions have been defined, they set up the smart contracts for the tokens and introduce the configuration in the Securitize Control Panel, which is linked to the company’s Issuer Portal.

## Token Deployment
Once an investment round has been completed and the full cap table has been uploaded to the Issuer Panel, Securitize will deploy the smart contracts. Once the smart contracts are deployed, each investor can issue the tokens. To facilitate the process, your Securitize Client Success Manager will complete the issuance for you via the Issuer Portal. Your investors are notified when the tokens are issued.

## Token Management
Securitize's Platform offers features related to the management of the token even after issuance.  Some of the notable features include
1. **Payouts and Distribution** - From Securitize's  Portal you can easily manage the distribution of dividends and other payouts, as it will give you an accurate overview of your past and current cap
table. 

2. **Lost or Stolen Tokens** - Securitize's  Digital Transfer Agent can easily destroy the tokens
and reissue the corresponding tokens to a new wallet the investor provides. You will be able to keep track of this via your Issuer Portal. 

3. **Provide Liquidity** - you can activate secondary trading on Securitize Markets to provide the potential for shareholder liquidity.

 **Primary and Secondary Markets**        
Securities Tokens are typically created in the primary market and traded on the secondary markets.

### The Primary Market
The Primary market is where security tokens are conceived. As it relates to private digital assets, this is when a company, otherwise referred to as the Issuer, lists an offering for investors to invest in. A private company issues tokens in order to raise capital to fund growth and or operations.

Securitize helps issuers structure offerings, prepare documentation, onboard investors, create and store digital assets/tokens, and enable the investment in, trade, and recording of digital assets in the distributed ledger.

### The Secondary Market
The secondary market is for trading securities previously issued in a primary offering. In this market, one investor will offer to sell a share of security in a marketplace where other investors are offering to buy shares; this is also called peer-to-peer trading. In the secondary market, the issuing company has no involvement in the trades.

Traditionally, the secondary market has been largely illiquid, however, that’s now changed with the advent of blockchain technology, the sale and transfer of securities are simplified, with the goal of providing greater secondary market trading activity. Companies like Securitize are helping buyers and sellers of digital asset securities connect and providing the infrastructure and resources necessary to facilitate peer-to-peer trading. Peer-to-peer trading opens up the potential of a more active marketplace where market price discovery is possible.
