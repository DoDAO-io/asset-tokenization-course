  shortTitle: What is Tokenization
  details: >
    Asset tokenization refers to the process of creating a digital token that
    represents a physical or digital asset, such as real estate, artwork, or
    even company shares, on a blockchain network. This token can then be bought,
    sold, and traded like any other cryptocurrency, and can also enable
    fractional ownership of assets, making it more accessible to a wider range
    of investors. Tokenization can also enable smart contract functionality,
    which can automate the process of buying and selling assets, and can also
    provide a tamper-proof and transparent record of ownership.


    ## Examples

    There are many examples of tokenized assets, some of which include:


    1. **Real estate**: Tokenization allows for the creation of digital tokens
    that represent ownership of a physical property, enabling fractional
    ownership and more efficient trading of real estate.


    2. **Art**: Tokenization can be used to represent ownership of fine art,
    making it more accessible to a wider range of investors and collectors.


    3. **Stocks**: Tokenization can be used to represent ownership of company
    shares, enabling more efficient and secure trading of stocks.


    4. **Commodities**: Tokenization can be used to represent ownership of
    commodities such as gold, oil, and other precious metals, enabling more
    efficient trading and storage.


    5. **Collectibles**: Tokenization can be used to represent ownership of
    collectible items such as sports cards, comic books, and other rare items,
    making it more accessible to a wider range of collectors.


    6. **Music rights**: Tokenization can be used to represent ownership of
    music rights, making it more efficient for creators and investors to manage
    and monetize music.


    7. **Luxury goods**: Tokenization can be used to represent ownership of
    luxury goods such as designer clothes, watches and handbags, making it more
    accessible for investors and collectors.


    These are just a few examples and the possibilities are endless, as any
    asset can be tokenized.
