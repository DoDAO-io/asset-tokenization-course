  shortTitle: What is Tokenization
  details: >+
    Asset tokenization refers to the process of creating a digital token that
    represents a physical or digital asset, such as real estate, artwork, or
    even company shares, on a blockchain network. This token can then be bought,
    sold, and traded like any other cryptocurrency, and can also enable
    fractional ownership of assets, making it more accessible to a wider range
    of investors. Tokenization can also enable smart contract functionality,
    which can automate the process of buying and selling assets, and can also
    provide a tamper-proof and transparent record of ownership.
