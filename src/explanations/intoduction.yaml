  title: What is Asset Tokenization?
  shortTitle: What is Tokenization
  details: >
    A token is a digital unit of cryptocurrency that is either used as a
    specific asset or it represents a particular use on the blockchain. Tokens
    can have multiple use cases but the most common ones are as security,
    utility or governance tokens. 


    Asset tokenization refers to the process of creating a digital token that
    represents a physical or digital asset, such as real estate, artwork, or
    even company shares, on a blockchain network. 


    This token can then be bought, sold, and traded like any other
    cryptocurrency, and can also enable fractional ownership of assets, making
    it more accessible to a wider range of investors. Tokenization can also
    enable smart contract functionality, which can automate the process of
    buying and selling assets, and can also provide a tamper-proof and
    transparent record of ownership.


    ## Use Cases of Tokenization

    There are many examples of tokenized assets, some of which include:


    1. **Real estate**: Tokenization allows for the creation of digital tokens
    that represent ownership of a physical property, enabling fractional
    ownership and more efficient trading of real estate.


    2. **Art**: Tokenization can be used to represent ownership of fine art,
    making it more accessible to a wider range of investors and collectors.


    3. **Stocks**: Tokenization can be used to represent ownership of company
    shares, enabling more efficient and secure trading of stocks.


    4. **Commodities**: Tokenization can be used to represent ownership of
    commodities such as gold, oil, and other precious metals, enabling more
    efficient trading and storage.


    5. **Collectibles**: Tokenization can be used to represent ownership of
    collectible items such as sports cards, comic books, and other rare items,
    making it more accessible to a wider range of collectors.


    6. **Music rights**: Tokenization can be used to represent ownership of
    music rights, making it more efficient for creators and investors to manage
    and monetize music.


    7. **Luxury goods**: Tokenization can be used to represent ownership of
    luxury goods such as designer clothes, watches and handbags, making it more
    accessible for investors and collectors.


    These are just a few examples and the possibilities are endless, as any
    asset can be tokenized.

    1.  **Global Reach** - Some of the most stable companies to invest in are
    ones like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Tesla. However, there are plenty of
    people globally who don't have access to these modern growth stocks.
    Blockchain enables a global financial system, giving small investors the
    opportunity to invest across borders. This allows everyone to have a fair
    chance at growing their wealth.


    2. **Increased Speed and Lower Cost** - With automation in the issuance,
    distribution, and management of securities, as well as securities servicing
    and corporate actions, the entire securities transaction process becomes
    more efficient and cost-effective for both issuers and investors.
    Additionally, the distributed nature of the network with no single point of
    failure, the immutability of the ledger, and the application of cryptography
    make the infrastructure more resilient and safe.


    3. **Transparency** - Transparency is one of the key benefits that
    blockchain technology can bring to the financial markets. By enhancing
    information recording and sharing, blockchain can help create a more
    transparent market environment, with data that is more accurate and
    reliable. This in turn can help boost investor confidence and make the
    markets more efficient. Additionally, the decentralized nature of blockchain
    can help reduce the risks of fraud and corruption, as well as improve
    audibility.


    4. **Fractional Ownership** -  As blockchain assets can be divided into
    smaller units, this increases liquidity. For example, a traditional real
    estate transfer usually requires the entire property to be transferred from
    seller to buyer. However, when real estate is tokenized, it can be divided
    and sold as units. This makes it easier to trade in a number of ways. There
    are lower capital requirements for potential buyers, which expands the pool
    of potential investors. Shares of a tokenized asset are more affordable,
    making it more accessible to a wider range of people solving high price
    entry barriers.


    5. **Cost savings** -  Tokenization has the potential to reduce costs in a
    variety of ways, for example, by settling trades instantaneously, reducing
    delivery charge as assets are sold digitally . By this risk for the fund is
    also greatly reduced. Tokens also allow for secondary market trading, which
    could help maintain assets under management while simultaneously reducing
    the cost of maintaining liquidity in the fund. Tokenizing also helps owners
    keep track of their assets as well as gives them more control over their
    investment.


    6. **Better Regulation** - real-time information about on-chain events can
    help regulators better understand what's happening with specific projects.
    This, in turn, can lead to more informed decision-making when it comes to
    compliance and interactions with those behind the project.

  shortTitle: Downsides
  details: >-
    While tokenization has many potential benefits, including innovation,
    efficiency, security and enhanced liquidity, it also has some potential
    downsides.


    * **Complexity**: Tokenization can be a complex process, requiring technical
    expertise and specialized knowledge of blockchain technology. There is a
    steep learning curve on both the token issuer and the user side. The first
    step of getting started with  blockchain is setting up a wallet and getting
    some funds in, which in itself can be a very complex task for non technical
    users.


    * **Security risks**: Your tokens are always at risk of being lost if you
    forget your private key or if someone gets access to it. Since the
    cryptocurrency industry is not regulated, there are no checks by any
    government authority. In 2022, we saw many customers lose their funds as
    many exchanges were using customer's tokens for riskier bets without their
    consent.


    * **Regulation**: Tokenization is a new and unregulated area, which can
    create uncertainty and potential legal issues. Until the technology and
    tokens themselves are regulated, it cannot get investment from some of the
    biggest institutions like pension funds etc.


    * **High transaction fees**: Tokenization can be a great way for fractional
    ownership or getting liquidity, but it's important to be aware of the
    potential fees involved. When transacting on Bitcoin or Ethereum, for
    example, you may have to pay transaction fees. In contrast, many simple
    transactions made through centralized banks are free of charge.
    Additionally, banks often profit from hidden fees - which is not typically
    the case in decentralized finance.

    A Token can be thought of as a representation of value that can be exchanged
    or traded in most cases.


    There are many different types of tokens:

    1) **Coins/AltCoins** - These are native to blockchain and can be used for
    payments or to power transactions. The most 
       famous type of coins are Bitcoin(BTC) and Ethereum(ETH). These are normally awarded to the validators of the 
       transaction, but can also be bought and exchanged.
    2) **Security tokens** -  are digital assets that represent some type of
    underlying asset, equity, or commodity. There are many different types of
    security tokens, including:

       1) **Stocks or Bonds** - These tokens represent an underlying stock or bond. They help investors from any country gain exposure to one of the most famous stocks or bonds.

       2) **Commodities** - These tokens represent a commodity, such as gold or oil. They help investors from any country gain exposure to the commodity market.

       3) **Real Estate** - These tokens represent a piece of property. They help investors from any country gain exposure to the real estate market.
    3) **Protocol/product tokens** - these tokens are issued by a protocol and
    may or may not have any utility or governance power related to them.
    Examples of these tokens include MKR, AAVE and COMP. 

    4) **Utility Tokens** - they can serve any purpose that a developer wants
    them to. In general, utility tokens provide access to a specific service or
    product within a blockchain ecosystem. They can often be the same as the
    protocol token or can be different. 

    5) **Governance Tokens** - Governance tokens are primarily used for voting
    and decision-making within a protocol or organization. They may also offer
    some financial incentives, but their main purpose is to give token holders a
    say in how the protocol or organization is run.

    6) **Cause-Based Tokens** - they are designed to support a specific cause or
    charity. They typically don't offer any financial incentives or utility, but
    are meant to show support for the cause they represent. 

    7) **NFTs** - NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are a type of cryptocurrency
    that is limited in supply and has a unique identity. NFTs are difficult to
    copy or replicate, making them ideal for representing digital or real-world
    assets such as paintings, photographs, or other materials.


    Asset token primary relates to **Security Tokens**.


    For asset or equity-backed tokens, there is usually a custodian and an
    investment institution involved in the process of creating a tokenized
    stock, assets or commodities. The institution buys the underlying stock and
    deposits it with the custodian. Based on the number of shares that the
    custodian holds in reserve, tokens are issued on a blockchain. The price of
    each token is pegged to the value of the shares.This process allows for a
    more efficient way of buying and selling stocks or assets, as well as a more
    secure way of storing them. By using a blockchain, there is no need for a
    third party to keep track of ownership or transactions. This makes the
    process more transparent and less susceptible to fraud.


    In 2022, many cryptocurrency exchanges went bankrupt because the tokens they
    were holding were not kept isolated. These exchanges were centralized
    entities that were built on top of decentralized technology, and they didn't
    disclose whether or not users' funds were backed 1:1 at all times. As an
    educated blockchain user, we should be aware whenever we are depositing
    custody of our assets or tokens to anyone else.

    Asset tokens are created when real world assets are placed on a blockchain
    and made tradable. The majority of these assets are security tokens. In
    2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ruled that digital asset
    securities must follow the same regulations as traditional securities. The
    SEC sees digital asset securities as under their domain and, as such, these
    assets are subject to the same laws as traditional securities.


    ---

    Digital asset securities come in the form of tokens. These security tokens
    represent a financial interest in an asset. Investors pay for tokens using
    fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar or cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or
    Ethereum. It is fundamental to understand that while both digital asset
    securities and cryptocurrencies are tokens, comparing them is akin to
    comparing a share of stock to a dollar bill. A share of stock represents
    ownership in a company, and a dollar bill represents purchasing power.





    In the most recent years, the SEC has introduced changes to make the private
    markets more accessible to individual investors and to make fundraising from
    a broader group of investors more accessible to private companies. They’ve
    done this through new regulations, such as Regulation Crowd Funding (CF) CF,
    Regulation A+ (also called the mini-IPO) and others, which allow accredited
    individual investors - and some retail investors - to participate.


    Along with these changes in regulation is also the introduction of the
    blockchain and companies like Securitize leverage decentralized ledgers to
    issue and record ownership for private market securities. These newer
    companies are different from the intermediaries in the public markets in
    that they are operating on the latest technology, which enables them to
    offer a single, fully-digital process that makes it possible for trade
    settlements to occur within the same day as opposed to days or weeks (like
    the public and secondary market). Advances by companies like Securitize are
    enabling liquidity in both primary and secondary markets, answering the
    overwhelming demand for access, transparency, and security.
