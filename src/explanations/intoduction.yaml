  title: What is Asset Tokenization?
  shortTitle: What is Tokenization
  details: >
    A token is a digital unit of cryptocurrency that is either used as a
    specific asset or it represents a particular use on the blockchain. Tokens
    can have multiple use cases but the most common ones are as security,
    utility or governance tokens. 


    Asset tokenization refers to the process of creating a digital token that
    represents a physical or digital asset, such as real estate, artwork, or
    even company shares, on a blockchain network. 


    This token can then be bought, sold, and traded like any other
    cryptocurrency, and can also enable fractional ownership of assets, making
    it more accessible to a wider range of investors. Tokenization can also
    enable smart contract functionality, which can automate the process of
    buying and selling assets and can also provide a tamper-proof and
    transparent record of ownership.

    ## Use Cases of Tokenization

    There are many examples of tokenized assets, some of which include:


    1. **Real estate**: Tokenization allows for the creation of digital tokens
    that represent ownership of a physical property, enabling fractional
    ownership and more efficient trading of real estate.


    2. **Art**: Tokenization can be used to represent ownership of fine art,
    making it more accessible to a wider range of investors and collectors.


    3. **Stocks**: Tokenization can be used to represent ownership of company
    shares, enabling more efficient and secure trading of stocks.


    4. **Commodities**: Tokenization can be used to represent ownership of
    commodities such as gold, oil, and other precious metals, enabling more
    efficient trading and storage.


    5. **Collectibles**: Tokenization can be used to represent ownership of
    collectible items such as sports cards, comic books, and other rare items,
    making it more accessible to a wider range of collectors.


    6. **Music rights**: Tokenization can be used to represent ownership of
    music rights, making it more efficient for creators and investors to manage
    and monetize music.


    7. **Luxury goods**: Tokenization can be used to represent ownership of
    luxury goods such as designer clothes, watches and handbags, making it more
    accessible for investors and collectors.


    These are just a few examples and the possibilities are endless, as any
    asset can be tokenized.

  title: Benefits of Tokenization
  shortTitle: Benefits
  details: >
    1.  **Global Reach** - Some of the most stable companies to invest in are
    ones like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Tesla. However, there are plenty of
    people globally who don't have access to these modern growth stocks.
    Blockchain enables a global financial system, giving small investors the
    opportunity to invest across borders. This allows everyone to have a fair
    chance at growing their wealth.


    2. **Increased Speed and Lower Cost** - It's a common notion that digital
    activities with little-to-no human interaction tend to happen more quickly.
    That’s typically the case of financial activities leveraging the blockchain
    as well. With less human dependency for operational tasks, marketplaces
    leveraging the blockchain can trade 24/7 and take advantage of instant
    settlement, where unlike the T+2 (trade +2 days) settlement period
    associated with public market stock transactions, private marketplaces
    leveraging the blockchain typically can complete trades in minutes.



    3. **Transparency** - Transparency is one of the key benefits that
    blockchain technology can bring to the financial markets. By enhancing
    information recording and sharing, blockchain can help create a more
    transparent market environment, with data that is more accurate and
    reliable. This in turn can help boost investor confidence and make the
    markets more efficient. Additionally, the decentralized nature of blockchain
    can help reduce the risks of fraud and corruption, as well as improve
    audibility.


    4. **Fractional Ownership** -  As blockchain assets can be divided into
    smaller units, this increases liquidity. For example, a traditional real
    estate transfer usually requires the entire property to be transferred from
    seller to buyer. However, when real estate is tokenized, it can be divided
    and sold as units. This makes it easier to trade in a number of ways. There
    are lower capital requirements for potential buyers, which expands the pool
    of potential investors. Shares of a tokenized asset are more affordable,
    making it more accessible to a wider range of people solving high price
    entry barriers.


    5. **Cost savings** -  Tokenization has the potential to reduce costs in a
    variety of ways, for example, by settling trades instantaneously, reducing
    delivery charge as assets are sold digitally . By this risk for the fund is
    also greatly reduced. Tokens also allow for secondary market trading, which
    could help maintain assets under management while simultaneously reducing
    the cost of maintaining liquidity in the fund. Tokenizing also helps owners
    keep track of their assets as well as gives them more control over their
    investment.


    6. **Better Regulation** - real-time information about on-chain events can
    help regulators better understand what's happening with specific projects.
    This, in turn, can lead to more informed decision-making when it comes to
    compliance and interactions with those behind the project.
- key: downsides-of-tokenization
  shortTitle: Downsides
  details: >-
    While tokenization has many potential benefits, including innovation,
    efficiency, security and enhanced liquidity, it also has some potential
    downsides.


    * **Complexity**: Tokenization can be a complex process, requiring technical
    expertise and specialized knowledge of blockchain technology. There is a
    steep learning curve on both the token issuer and the user side. The first
    step of getting started with  blockchain is setting up a wallet and getting
    some funds in, which in itself can be a very complex task for non technical
    users.


    * **Security risks**: Your tokens are always at risk of being lost if you
    forget your private key or if someone gets access to it. Since the
    cryptocurrency industry is not regulated, there are no checks by any
    government authority. In 2022, we saw many customers lose their funds as
    many exchanges were using customer's tokens for riskier bets without their
    consent.


    * **Regulation**: Tokenization is a new and unregulated area, which can
    create uncertainty and potential legal issues. Until the technology and
    tokens themselves are regulated, it cannot get investment from some of the
    biggest institutions like pension funds etc.


    * **High transaction fees**: Tokenization can be a great way for fractional
    ownership or getting liquidity, but it's important to be aware of the
    potential fees involved. When transacting on Bitcoin or Ethereum, for
    example, you may have to pay transaction fees. In contrast, many simple
    transactions made through centralized banks are free of charge.
    Additionally, banks often profit from hidden fees - which is not typically
    the case in decentralized finance.

    A Token can be thought of as a representation of value that can be exchanged
    or traded in most cases.


    There are many different types of tokens:

    1) **Coins/AltCoins** - These are native to blockchain and can be used for
    payments or to power transactions. The most 
       famous type of coins are Bitcoin(BTC) and Ethereum(ETH). These are normally awarded to the validators of the 
       transaction, but can also be bought and exchanged.
    2) **Security tokens** -  are digital assets that represent some type of
    underlying asset, equity, or commodity. There are many different types of
    security tokens, including:

       1) **Stocks or Bonds** - These tokens represent an underlying stock or bond. They help investors from any country gain exposure to one of the most famous stocks or bonds.

       2) **Commodities** - These tokens represent a commodity, such as gold or oil. They help investors from any country gain exposure to the commodity market.

       3) **Real Estate** - These tokens represent a piece of property. They help investors from any country gain exposure to the real estate market.
    3) **Protocol/product tokens** - these tokens are issued by a protocol and
    may or may not have any utility or governance power related to them.
    Examples of these tokens include MKR, AAVE and COMP. 

    4) **Utility Tokens** - they can serve any purpose that a developer wants
    them to. In general, utility tokens provide access to a specific service or
    product within a blockchain ecosystem. They can often be the same as the
    protocol token or can be different. 

    5) **Governance Tokens** - Governance tokens are primarily used for voting
    and decision-making within a protocol or organization. They may also offer
    some financial incentives, but their main purpose is to give token holders a
    say in how the protocol or organization is run.

    6) **Cause-Based Tokens** - they are designed to support a specific cause or
    charity. They typically don't offer any financial incentives or utility, but
    are meant to show support for the cause they represent. 

    7) **NFTs** - NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are a type of cryptocurrency
    that is limited in supply and has a unique identity. NFTs are difficult to
    copy or replicate, making them ideal for representing digital or real-world
    assets such as paintings, photographs, or other materials.


    Asset token primary relates to **Security Tokens**.


    For asset or equity-backed tokens, there is usually a custodian and an
    investment institution involved in the process of creating a tokenized
    stock, assets or commodities. The institution buys the underlying stock and
    deposits it with the custodian. Based on the number of shares that the
    custodian holds in reserve, tokens are issued on a blockchain. The price of
    each token is pegged to the value of the shares.This process allows for a
    more efficient way of buying and selling stocks or assets, as well as a more
    secure way of storing them. By using a blockchain, there is no need for a
    third party to keep track of ownership or transactions. This makes the
    process more transparent and less susceptible to fraud.


    In 2022, many cryptocurrency exchanges went bankrupt because the tokens they
    were holding were not kept isolated. These exchanges were centralized
    entities that were built on top of decentralized technology, and they didn't
    disclose whether or not users' funds were backed 1:1 at all times. As an
    educated blockchain user, we should be aware whenever we are depositing
    custody of our assets or tokens to anyone else.

    In 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ruled that digital
    asset securities must follow the same regulations as traditional securities.
    The SEC sees digital asset securities as under their domain and, as such,
    these assets are subject to the same laws as traditional securities.
    Security tokens, in the form of digital asset securities, represent a
    fractional ownership in an underlying asset. These assets can be investments
    like real estate, fine art, or venture capital. They can also be digital
    assets like a website, app, or even a blockchain. 


    Investors can purchase security tokens using fiat currencies such as the USD
    or cryptocurrencies such as BTC or ETH. 


    Although both digital asset securities and cryptocurrencies are tokens, it's
    important to note that they are not interchangeable. Comparing them would be
    like comparing a share of stock to a dollar bill, or to reward points.
    Cryptocurrencies can have various usages and utility, and not all the rules
    that apply to security tokens are applicable to other types of tokens.


    Digital Asset Securities (or “security tokens”) enable a 100% digital
    experience, removing

    lag-time while providing real-time data on cap tables and shareholder
    activity. Regulatory

    restrictions are enforced in smart contracts, which means compliance is
    automatically

    assessed so that only verified shareholders can hold and trade the digital
    shares.

    Many volatile markets aren't as risky as you might think if you understand
    the economics and patterns of that particular sector. Most of these markets
    are only accessible to retail investors with a lot of money. You can be one
    of the most knowledgeable people in that sector, but you won't be able to
    invest if you don't have enough money to meet the requirements set by
    government agencies.


    ## Public vs Private Markets

    Most retail investors are familiar with the public markets and investing in
    and trading securities such as public company stocks, mutual funds, and ETFs
    are highly accessible and inexpensive to trade through traditional brokerage
    firms. 


    Private markets remain largely unknown because most citizens are barred from
    participating. Private markets are not just about a select group of
    "unicorns" that have gone public. 


    Securities issued on the public market typically require extensive public
    disclosure through costly and time-consuming filings with regulators. To
    issue and maintain public debt, companies must disclose information about
    their finances, earnings, and performance while remaining accountable to
    shareholders. This costs cost associated with this can easily be $500,000+. 


    With limited access compared to public markets and historically less
    institutional participation, private markets were less liquid and very
    manual for companies and investors to trade. But like most things,  growing
    awareness of market potential led to greater demand and opened the door for
    change.


    Looking at trading volumes, we see a large discrepancy between the two
    markets. $33 trillion is traded annually on the public market, but only $100
    billion (or $0.1 trillion) is traded on the private market.
