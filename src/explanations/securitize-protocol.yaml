    Securitize is a platform that helps you automate your compliance using smart
    contracts. This way, only transfers between KYC verified accounts are
    executed, and instant payouts and distributions are made possible.
    Securitize is the perfect solution for companies looking to tokenize assets
    as part of a capital raise. They manage the entire process from legal setup
    and valuation, to auditing and investor onboarding, tokenization and cap
    table management. It ensures that the entire process is compliant with
    regulations, so companies can focus solely on running their business. 


    ### Issuer Portal

    Companies  will be given login access to a digital interface that is
    customized to manage their cap-table, track token ownership, communicate
    with shareholders, and much more. Issuer Portal will configure the specifics
    of offering, such as available currencies, minimum investment amount, start
    date, token price, subscription agreements, and other related data. This
    will be visible to the investors if companies host a Security Token Offering
    / capital raise.


    ### Investor Dashboard

    Customized with your brand assets, investors will have access to relevant
    information about your token, your company, and to manage any tokens they
    hold as a shareholder. You have access to edit and add content to this page
    at any time, including imagery, videos and reports.

    ### Determine the Blockchain

    Securitize has created integrations with  various blockchains like Ethereum,
    Algorand and Avalanche. They work with the projects to identify the most
    appropriate blockchain for their tokenization, taking into account factors
    such as gas fees, interoperability with the ecosystem . The Digital Security
    protocol is designed to automate and enforce compliance by, for example,
    only allowing transfers between KYC'd - whitelisted, and verified wallets.


    ### Define the Smart Contract

    Before tokenizing an asset or security, it’s important to establish what
    rights will be given to shareholders (i.e. voting rights), how many tokens
    will be issued and what compliance requirements and legal limitations, such
    as jurisdictional restrictions, the digital asset should include. Once these
    conditions have been defined, they set up the smart contracts for the tokens
    and introduce the configuration in the Securitize Control Panel, which is
    linked to the company’s Issuer Portal.


    ### Issuance of Tokens 

    Once an investment round has completed and the full cap-table has been
    uploaded to the Issuer Panel, Securitize will deploy the smart contracts.
    Once the smart contracts are deployed, the tokens can be issued to each
    investor. To facilitate the process, your Securitize Client Success Manager
    will complete the issuance for you via the Issuer Portal. Your investors are
    notified when the tokens are issued.
