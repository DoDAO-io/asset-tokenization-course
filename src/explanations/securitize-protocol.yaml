    Securitize is a platform that helps you automate your compliance using smart
    contracts. This way, only transfers between KYC verified accounts are
    executed, and instant payouts and distributions are made possible.
    Securitize is the perfect solution for companies looking to tokenize assets
    as part of a capital raise. They manage the entire process from legal setup
    and valuation, to auditing and investor onboarding, tokenization and cap
    table management. It ensures that the entire process is compliant with
    regulations, so companies can focus solely on running their business. 


    ### Issuer Portal

    Companies  will be given login access to a digital interface that is
    customized to manage their cap-table, track token ownership, communicate
    with shareholders, and much more. Issuer Portal will configure the specifics
    of offering, such as available currencies, minimum investment amount, start
    date, token price, subscription agreements, and other related data. This
    will be visible to the investors if companies host a Security Token Offering
    / capital raise.


    ### Investor Dashboard

    Customized with your brand assets, investors will have access to relevant
    information about your token, your company, and to manage any tokens they
    hold as a shareholder. You have access to edit and add content to this page
    at any time, including imagery, videos and reports.
