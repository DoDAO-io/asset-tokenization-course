    as part of a capital raise. They manage the entire process from legal setup
    and valuation, to auditing and investor onboarding, tokenization and cap
    table management. It ensures that the entire process is compliant with
    regulations, so companies can focus solely on running their business. 


    Securitize makes an effort to offer a diverse range of assets, including

    Securities and Alternative Assets.


    As additional offerings are released, investors able to view the specific
    asset categories described above.


    There has been a lack of clarity around how various tokens are treated by
    the SEC and Securitize make enables the use of new technology solutions at
    the same time it offers many different options to the token issues on how
    they can create their tokens and still remain compliant with the regulatory
    bodies.


    Securitize's functionality can be divided into two main sections:

    ### Issuer Portal

    Issuer Portal provides companies with a digital interface that is customized
    to manage their cap-table, track token ownership, communicate with
    shareholders, and much more. This interface helps companies in  configuring
    the specifics of their offering, such as available currencies, minimum
    investment amount, start date, token price, subscription agreements, and
    other related data. This is visible to the investors if companies host a
    Security Token Offering / capital raise.


    ### Investor Dashboard

    Customized with your brand assets, investors will have access to relevant
    information about your token, your company, and to manage any tokens they
    hold as a shareholder. You have access to edit and add content to this page
    at any time, including imagery, videos and reports.

    Rules of creation of tokens are implemented in a smart contract and then
    this smart contract is deployed to a blockchain. 



    ## Token Creation

    Securitize offers a lot of flexibility for the creation of your Token. If
    you are a blockchain developer with programming experience, you can create a
    token programmatically with all the rules required. However, Securitize
    automates most of these for token issuers and hides the technical
    complexity, and makes this process very simple even for non-technical
    people. Following are the steps involved when you create a new token in
    Securitize:


    ### Determine the Blockchain

    Securitize is blockchain agnostic, which means they have created
    integrations with multiple different blockchains in order to be able to work
    with a variety of projects. They work with the projects to identify the most
    appropriate blockchain for their tokenization by considering various factors
    such as gas fees and interoperability with the ecosystem. By doing this,
    they are able to provide each project with the best possible solution for
    their needs.


    ### Define the Smart Contract

    Before tokenizing an asset or security, it’s crucial to establish what
    rights will be given to shareholders (i.e. voting rights), how many tokens
    will be issued, and what compliance requirements and legal limitations, such
    as jurisdictional restrictions, the digital asset should include. Once these
    conditions have been defined, they set up the smart contracts for the tokens
    and introduce the configuration in the Securitize Control Panel, which is
    linked to the company’s Issuer Portal.


    ### Issuance of Tokens 

    Once an investment round has been completed and the full cap table has been
    uploaded to the Issuer Panel, Securitize will deploy the smart contracts.
    Once the smart contracts are deployed, each investor can issue the tokens.
    To facilitate the process, your Securitize Client Success Manager will
    complete the issuance for you via the Issuer Portal. Your investors are
    notified when the tokens are issued.

    relevant about the token, company and how to manage any tokens they hold as
    a shareholder. Companies can edit and add content on this page anytime you
    want, including images, videos and reports.

    traditional book-entry methods.

    digital asset wallet keys. 
     
    The Issuer Portal makes it easy to manage the distribution of dividends and
    other payouts, with an accurate overview of your past and current cap table.
    If tokens are stolen or lost, Digital Transfer Agent can easily destroy them

    provides. Investors will be able to keep track of this via your Issuer
    Portal.

    Earlier, only accredited or institutional investors were able to invest in
    companies that were not publicly traded on stock exchanges. If such private
    companies needed to raise funds, they had to issue debt or equity to these
    accredited investors. However, this created a loophole in the investing
    process, as these private companies were not open  to offer any stake in the
    business to the general public. 


    This changed with the introduction of crowdfunding, which allows anyone to
    invest in a company in return for equity. However, the stake in private
    companies can only be diluted if the company is listed on a stock exchange
    or acquired by another company. This means that the invested funds can be
    locked up for a long period of time. 


    Blockchain technology provides a solution to this by allowing private
    companies to tokenize their equity and offer those tokens to investors
    through crowdfunding or offering them on blockchain protocols. These tokens
    can then easily be traded on secondary markets, giving investors the freedom
    to trade their investment at any time they want.


    Securitize offers primary and secondary offerings to allow anyone to invest
    in private companies and other major funds (eg:- Art funds).

    The main difference between primary and secondary offerings on securitize is
    that primary market offerings have a minimum lock-up period of one year, and
    investors get voting rights in decisions related to the particular fund. In
    contrast, secondary market offerings don't have a lock-up period, and
    investors don't get voting rights. In primary offerings, once the lock-up
    period of 1 year is over, investors have to find a potential buyer of the
    token to divest .
