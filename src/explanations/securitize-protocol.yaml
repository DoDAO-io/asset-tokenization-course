    Rules of creation of tokens are implemented in a smart contract and then
    this smart contract is deployed to a blockchain. 



    ## Token Creation

    Securitize offers a lot of flexibility for the creation of your Token. If
    you are a blockchain developer with programming experience, you can create a
    token programmatically with all the rules required. However, Securitize
    automates most of these for token issuers and hides the technical
    complexity, and makes this process very simple even for non-technical
    people. Following are the steps involved when you create a new token in
    Securitize:


    1. **Determine the Blockchain** - Securitize is blockchain agnostic, which
    means they have created integrations with multiple different blockchains in
    order to work with a variety of projects. They work with the projects to
    identify the most appropriate blockchain for their tokenization by
    considering various factors such as gas fees and interoperability with the
    ecosystem. By doing this, they can provide each project with the best
    possible solution for their needs.


    2. **Define the Smart Contract** - Before tokenizing an asset or security,
    it’s crucial to establish what rights will be given to shareholders (i.e.
    voting rights), how many tokens will be issued, and what compliance
    requirements and legal limitations, such as jurisdictional restrictions, the
    digital asset should include. Once these conditions have been defined, they
    set up the smart contracts for the tokens and introduce the configuration in
    the Securitize Control Panel, which is linked to the company’s Issuer
    Portal.


    ## Token Deployment

    Once an investment round has been completed and the full cap table has been
    uploaded to the Issuer Panel, Securitize will deploy the smart contracts.
    Once the smart contracts are deployed, each investor can issue the tokens.
    To facilitate the process, your Securitize Client Success Manager will
    complete the issuance for you via the Issuer Portal. Your investors are
    notified when the tokens are issued.


    ## Token Management

    Securitize's Platform offers features related to the management of the token
    even after issuance.  Some of the notable features include

    1. **Payouts and Distribution** - From Securitize's  Portal you can easily
    manage the distribution of dividends and other payouts, as it will give you
    an accurate overview of your past and current cap

    table. 


    2. **Lost or Stolen Tokens** - Securitize's  Digital Transfer Agent can
    easily destroy the tokens

    and reissue the corresponding tokens to a new wallet the investor provides.
    You will be able to keep track of this via your Issuer Portal. 


    3. **Provide Liquidity** - you can activate secondary trading on Securitize
    Markets to provide the potential for shareholder liquidity.

    Earlier, only accredited or institutional investors were able to invest in
    companies that were not publicly traded on stock exchanges. If such private
    companies needed to raise funds, they had to issue debt or equity to these
    accredited investors. However, this created a loophole in the investing
    process, as these private companies were not open  to offer any stake in the
    business to the general public. 


    This changed with the introduction of crowdfunding, which allows anyone to
    invest in a company in return for equity. However, the stake in private
    companies can only be diluted if the company is listed on a stock exchange
    or acquired by another company. This means that the invested funds can be
    locked up for a long period of time. 


    Blockchain technology provides a solution to this by allowing private
    companies to tokenize their equity and offer those tokens to investors
    through crowdfunding or offering them on blockchain protocols. These tokens
    can then easily be traded on secondary markets, giving investors the freedom
    to trade their investment at any time they want.


    Securitize offers primary and secondary offerings to allow anyone to invest
    in private companies and other major funds (eg:- Art funds).

    The main difference between primary and secondary offerings on securitize is
    that primary market offerings have a minimum lock-up period of one year, and
    investors get voting rights in decisions related to the particular fund. In
    contrast, secondary market offerings don't have a lock-up period, and
    investors don't get voting rights. In primary offerings, once the lock-up
    period of 1 year is over, investors have to find a potential buyer of the
    token to divest .
