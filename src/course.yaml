  Asset tokenization is the process of converting rights to an asset, such as
  real estate or art, into a digital token on a blockchain. This token can then
  be bought, sold, and traded on a blockchain-based marketplace, similar to how
  stocks are traded on a stock exchange. By tokenizing assets, it allows for
  fractional ownership and increased liquidity, as well as enabling new
  investment opportunities for investors.

  1) Chapter 1 - Introduction - Benefits and Drawbacks of Tokenization

  2) Chapter 2 - Securitize Platform

      Securitize is the perfect solution for companies looking to tokenize
      assets as part of a capital raise. They manage the entire process from
      legal setup and valuation, to auditing and investor onboarding,
      tokenization and cap table management. It ensures that the entire process
      is compliant with regulations, so companies can focus solely on running
      their business.
