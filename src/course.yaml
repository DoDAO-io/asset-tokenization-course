    details: >
      Securitize is a platform that helps you automate your compliance using
      smart contracts. This way, only transfers between KYC verified accounts
      are executed, and instant payouts and distributions are made possible.
      Securitize is the perfect solution for companies looking to tokenize
      assets as part of a capital raise. They manage the entire process from
      legal setup and valuation, to auditing and investor onboarding,
      tokenization and cap table management. It ensures that the entire process
      is compliant with regulations, so companies can focus solely on running
      their business.
